<h1>Module Interned_string</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Interned_string</pre><div class="info">Provides a functor for creating an interned string type.<br/>    An interned string is internally an int which is an index into a lookup table, which
    makes hashing and (non-lexicographic) comparison faster than for strings.  The
    tradeoff is that converting an interned string to and from a string is slower, since
    they require table lookups instead of being no-ops.<br/>    Some notes on the implementation:<br/>    - It is not thread-safe (different applications of the functor can be used
      safely from different threads, but an individual interned string module
      is not safe to use concurrently from different threads.)<ul><li>It is leaky, meaning that an interned string, once allocated, will never be
      deallocated.</li><li>Interned strings are compared based on the integer they are assigned on creation,
      which is not a lexicographic order, and is not necessarily stable between runs of a
      program.</li></ul>    The semantics of the other operations should be the same as for <code class="code">String</code>.<br/>    We don't fix the memory leak with weak pointers for performance reasons.  See
    <code class="code">jane</code>/interns/ahuq/strint/README at revision b9a2b9dbf290.</div>
