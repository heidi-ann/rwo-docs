<h1>Module Avltree</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Avltree</pre><div class="info">This module implements a very low level interface to a mutable AVL tree. It is not
    intended to be used directly by casual users. It is used for implementing other data
    structures. The interface is somewhat ugly, and it's that way for a reason. The goal
    of this module is minimum memory overhead, and maximum performance.<br/>**************** Points of Ugliness *****************<br/> compare is passed in to every function where it is used. If you pass a different
    compare to functions on the same tree, then all bets are off as far as what it does,
    and it's all your fault. Why? Because otherwise we'd need a top level record to store
    compare, and when building a hash table, or other structure, that little t is a block
    that increases memory overhead. However, if an empty tree is just a constructor
    'Empty', then it's just a number, and uses no extra memory beyond the array bucket
    that holds it. That's the first secret of how Core_hashtbl's memory overhead isn't
    higher than INRIA's, even though it uses a tree instead of a list for buckets.<br/> But you said it's mutable, why do all the 'mutators' return t. Answer, it is
    mutable, but the root node might change due to balancing. Since we have no top level
    record to hold the current root node (see point 1), you have to do it. If you fail to
    do it, and use an old root node, you're responsible for the (sure to be nasty)
    consequences.<br/> What on earth is up with the ~removed argument to some functions. See point 1, since
    there is no top level node, it isn't possible to keep track of how many nodes are in
    the tree unless each mutator tells you whether or not it added or removed a node, vs
    replacing an existing one. If you intend to keep a count (as you must in a hash
    table), then you will need to pay attention to this flag.<br/>    After all this, you're probably asking yourself whether all these hacks are worth
    it. Yes! They are! With them, we built a hash table that is faster than INRIA's (no
    small feat actually), with the same memory overhead, with sane add semantics (the add
    semantics they used were a performance hack), and with worst case log(N) insertion,
    lookup, and removal. I'd say that's worth it. But for those of you who will feel
    morally compelled to put in a CR about this interface. I challenge you to write a
    better interface, implement a hash table with it, and show that your table has better
    performance than Core_hashtbl.</div>
