<h1>Module Core_int63</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Core_int63</pre><div class="info">The size of Int63 is always at least 63 bits.  On a 64-bit platform it is just an int
    (63-bits), and on a 32-bit platform it is an int64.<br/>    Because Int63 has different sizes on 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, there are several
    pitfalls to be aware of:<br/>    - Int63 will behave differently in the case of overflow.<br/>    - marshalling Int63 will not work between 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.
    unmarshal will segfault.<br/>    - bin_io will work, except that it will raise an overflow exception when you send too
      large of an int from a 32-bit to a 64-bit platform.  This is couterintuitive because
      the 32-bit platform has the larger int size.</div>
