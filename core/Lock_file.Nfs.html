<h1>Module Lock_file.Nfs</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> <a href="Lock_file.Nfs.html">Nfs</a> : <code class="code">sig</code> <a href="Lock_file.Nfs.html">..</a> <code class="code">end</code></pre><div class="info">An implementation neutral NFS lock file scheme that relies on the atomicity of link
    over NFS (see NFS Illustrated, atomicity for more information).  Rather than relying
    on a working traditional advisory lock system over NFS we create a hard link between
    the file given to the create call and a new file &lt;filename&gt;.nfs_lock.  This link call
    is atomic (in that it succeeds or fails) across all systems that have the same
    filesystem mounted.  The link file must be cleaned up on program exit (normally
    accomplished by an at_exit handler, but see caveats below).<br/>    There are a few caveats compared to local file locks:<br/>    - These calls require the locker to have write access to the directory containing the
      file being locked.<br/>    - Unlike a normal flock call the lock may not be removed when the calling program
      exits (in particular if it is killed with SIGKILL).</div>
