<h1>Module Marshal</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Marshal</pre><div class="info">Marshaling of data structures.<br/>   This module provides functions to encode arbitrary data structures
   as sequences of bytes, which can then be written on a file or
   sent over a pipe or network connection.  The bytes can then
   be read back later, possibly in another process, and decoded back
   into a data structure. The format for the byte sequences
   is compatible across all machines for a given version of OCaml.<br/>   Warning: marshaling is currently not type-safe. The type
   of marshaled data is not transmitted along the value of the data,
   making it impossible to check that the data read back possesses the
   type expected by the context. In particular, the result type of
   the <code class="code">Marshal.from_*</code> functions is given as <code class="code">'a</code>, but this is
   misleading: the returned OCaml value does not possess type <code class="code">'a</code>
   for all <code class="code">'a</code>; it has one, unique type which cannot be determined
   at compile-type.  The programmer should explicitly give the expected
   type of the returned value, using the following syntax:<ul><li><code class="code">(Marshal.from_channel chan : type)</code>.
   Anything can happen at run-time if the object in the file does not
   belong to the given type.</li></ul>   The representation of marshaled values is not human-readable,
   and uses bytes that are not printable characters. Therefore,
   input and output channels used in conjunction with <code class="code">Marshal.to_channel</code>
   and <code class="code">Marshal.from_channel</code> must be opened in binary mode, using e.g.
   <code class="code">open_out_bin</code> or <code class="code">open_in_bin</code>; channels opened in text mode will
   cause unmarshaling errors on platforms where text channels behave
   differently than binary channels, e.g. Windows.</div>
