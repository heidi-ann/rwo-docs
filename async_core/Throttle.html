<h1>Module Throttle</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Throttle</pre><div class="info">Throttles to limit the number of concurrent computations.<br/>    A throttle is essentially a pipe to which one can feed jobs.<br/>    A throttle schedules asynchronous jobs so that at any given point in time no more than
    <code class="code">max_concurrent_jobs</code> jobs are running.  A job <code class="code">f</code> is considered to be running from
    the time <code class="code">f ()</code> is executed until the deferred returned by <code class="code">f ()</code> becomes determined,
    or <code class="code">f ()</code> raises.  The throttle intiates jobs first-come first-served.<br/>    One can use <code class="code">create_with</code> to create a throttle with &quot;resources&quot; that one would
    like to make available to concurrent jobs and to guarantee that different jobs
    access different resources.<br/>    A throttle &quot;dies&quot; if one of its jobs throws an exception, and the throttle has
    <code class="code">continue_on_error = false</code>.  If a throttle dies, then all jobs in it that haven't yet
    started will be aborted, i.e. they will not start and will become determined with
    <code class="code">`Aborted</code>.  Jobs that had already started will continue, and return <code class="code">`Ok</code> or
    <code class="code">`Raised</code> as usual when they finish.  Attempts to enqueue a job into a dead throttle
    will fail.</div>
