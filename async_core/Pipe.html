<h1>Module Pipe</h1>
<pre><span class="keyword">module</span> Pipe</pre><div class="info">A pipe is a buffered FIFO communication channel.<br/>    A pipe has a &quot;writer&quot; end and a &quot;reader&quot; end.  The intent is that a writer feeds
    values into the pipe and then waits until it is notified that it should put more data
    in (referred to as &quot;pushback&quot;).<br/>    Each pipe contains a buffer that is a queue of values that have been written to the
    pipe but not yet read from the pipe.  The length of the queue is not bounded; whenever
    the pipe is written to, values are immediately enqueued.  However, writers are
    supposed to respect pushback from readers, either via the <code class="code">unit Deferred.t</code> returned
    by <code class="code">write</code> calls or by explicitly calling <code class="code">pushback</code>.<br/>    If a pipe is empty, then readers queue up, waiting for values to be written.  As soon
    as values are written, if a reader is available to consume them, the values will be
    handed to the reader.<br/>    One can use <code class="code">flushed</code> to get notified by a pipe when all prior writes have been
    consumed by a reader.<br/>    There are distinct <code class="code">Reader</code> and <code class="code">Writer</code> modules and types, but all of the operations
    on readers and writers are available directly from the <code class="code">Pipe</code> module.</div>
